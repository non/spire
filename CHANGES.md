## Experimental branch

* split Opt and cfor macros in spire-kernel module #651
* new shadowing infrastructure to test range-limited types such as Byte, UByte, ...
  superceding the old code in #642
* migrated spire-laws to the new cats 1.0.0-RC1 style, completed the tests along the way
* small fixes in commutative rings (some types did not implement the correct ring typeclass)
* refactored SignedXXX into Signed.OnXXX
* fixed the sparse polynomial bug #653
* split modules into left modules, right modules and modules over commutative ring
* precised that our RingAlgebra is actually an associative algebra (otherwise it is not a Rng);
  Wikipedia specifies that actually the module is a Ring, not a Rng, and the scalar is a CRing

To review:
* The vector spaces over Map, Seq; how do we handle zero elements?

To discuss:
* Removed Torsor, AdditiveAction, MultiplicativeAction which are not currently used?
* We removed IdentityModule and ZModule (automatic derivation of that stuff can be dangerous),
  and we would have to write IdentityLeftModule, IdentityRightModule, IdentityCModule, etc...
* Removed the unbound ops (shouldn't the scalar typeclass be imported by the user if needed?)
  because the module refactoring make the update nontrival
* Removed automatic derivation of a metric for IsReal
* Removed inner product spaces, coordinate spaces, normed vector spaces, as they are only properly
  defined for real vector spaces
* Revise and document the standard instances for Seq, Array, Map, ...

## Version 0.14.0

This release is a major milestone for Spire.

First of all, it introduces a dependency on typelevel/algebra (and
thus on typelevel/cats-kernel). This provides immediate compatibility
with Cats and Algebird.

Second of all, Spire is now published to the org.typelevel
organization (which was previously org.spire-math).

Additions: 
 * Added GCDRing, part of the commutative ring hierarchy
 * Clarified the laws of EuclideanRing
 * Added DivisionRing, a ring in which division is possible
   (generalization of fields to the noncommutative case;
   used now by Spire's quaternions).

Changes:
 * Many type classes are now aliases to algebra's type classes
 * Algebra provides commutative rings and fields, but the
   intemediate structures (GCDRing/EuclideanRing) are added
   by Spire; thus Spire Field differs from algebra Field by
   extending GCDRing and EuclideanRing.
 * The EuclidenRing operations for Field have been corrected;
   in particular, Float, Double no longer perform truncated division
   but a /~ b = 0 for nonzero b, as a can always be divided by b in a
   field.
 * Signed now extends Order, thus IsReal only extends Signed.
 * IsReal has been replaced by Signed for some operations in
   e.g. Complex, making them more precise/general.
 * Many different efficiency improvements

Fixes:
 * Instances for Complex and Quaternion are more precise
 * Numeric[Complex[A]] is no longer provided
 * Many bug fixes

## Version 0.13.0

Additions:
 * Added Eq[Bound[A]] instance
 * Added Interval#overlap and supporting machinery

Changes:
 * Improve Polynomial performance
 * Support negative roots for Real
 * Migrate to newer ScalaCheck

Fixes:
 * Fix bugs in root isolation/refinement for Algebraic

## Version 0.12.0

Additions:
 * IntervalSeq and IntervalTrie added to spire-extras
 * .toReal and .toAlgebraic methods on Rational

Changes:
 * Package restructuring and improvements

Fixes:
 * Numerous bug fixes

## Version 0.11.0

Spire has two new core maintainers: Rüdiger Klaehn and Denis Rosset.

The spire-scalacheck-binding package has been renamed to spire-laws.
The spire-extras package has been introduced, for types that are less
widely-used (but still useful).
