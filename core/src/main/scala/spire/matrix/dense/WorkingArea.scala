/**
 * Many matrix algorithms need to create temporary vectors or matrices within
 * a loop over the columns or the rows of the matrix to operate on. Allocating
 * or deallocating memory at every loop iteration would be very inefficient.
 * This is the  raisons d'Ãªtre of the parameter WORK passed to many LAPACK
 * routines: client code is required to allocate enough memory for the biggest
 * temporary to fit in WORK and then pass its address to the LAPACK routine.
 * In turn, each LAPACK routine will pass WORK to the subroutine that needs it.
 * We keep the same scheme but we use an implicit argument `work` instead,
 * of type Scratchpad.
 *
 * In the future, client codes using the higher level interfaces should
 * most of the time not concern themselves with these details as those
 * interfaces will be implemented so as to provide a reasonably sized
 * default value for the implicit parameter `work`. However in some cases,
 * it may be more efficient for the client code to create `work` beforehand
 * and pass it to the algorithm. For example, when computing many eigen-
 * decompositions for matrices of varying size, it would be better
 * to create a scratchpad large enough to work with the biggest matrix.
 * Therefore the lower level interfaces (e.g. Hessenberge.DecompositionXXX)
 * do not create a default scratchpad. But they provide an API to query the
 * scratchpad they need, so that client code can create it without having
 * to know about internal algorithmic details.
