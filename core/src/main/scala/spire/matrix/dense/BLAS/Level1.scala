/**
 * An implementation of the infamous Basic Linear Algebra System, level 1
 *
 * BLAS level 1 is concerned with those basic operations
 * that references O(n) elements and that performs O(n) flops,
 * where n is the size of the problem. Those operations are:
 *
 *   - vector scaling
 *   - linear combination of two vectors
 *   - vector dot product and norm
 *   - plane rotations
 *
 * The BLAS function declarations are altered as follow:
 *
 *   - we remove only the leading character (S, D, Z) indicating the type
 *     of elements, therefore keeping the next 2 characters indicating the type
 *     of matrices (GE for general, SY for symmetric, TR for triangular, ...)
 *   - we do not pass either the vector size or stride as they are encapsulated
 *     in the arguments of type VectorLike.
 *
