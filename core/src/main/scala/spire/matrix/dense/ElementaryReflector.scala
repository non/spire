/**
 * Elementary Reflector
 *
 * We use LAPACK conventions [1].
 *
 * An elementary reflector of order n is a n x n orthogonal matrix of the form
 *
 *     H = I - τ v v^T^
 *
 * where τ is a scalar and v is a vector of size n. This is also named
 * a Householder matrix (not because Householder invented the concept, which
 * had been known for about a century, but because he found new and interesting
 * ways to use them). We will always assume that v(0) = 1 and therefore we will
 * only require the knowledge of v(1:n), the so-called essential part of the
 * reflector [2].
 *

 *     and D Sorensen.
 *     Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics,
 *     Philadelphia, PA, Third.
 *
 * [2] LAPACK only ever constructs reflectors with v(0) = 1 but the subroutine
 * applying the reflectors to matrices do not assume that, forcing the client
 * code using them to set v(0) = 1 by hand, and eventually to restore v(0) to
 * its original value because v always share storage with a matrix row or column
 * for which v(0) aliases an element that is part of the desired output. We
 * prefer to avoid this ugly hack altogether.
