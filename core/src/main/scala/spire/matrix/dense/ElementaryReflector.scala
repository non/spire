/**
 * Elementary Reflector
 *
 * We use LAPACK conventions [1].
 *
 * An elementary reflector of order n is a n x n matrix of the form
 * \[
 *     H = I - \tau v v^T
 * \]
 * where $\tau$ is a scalar and $v$ is a vector of size n. This is also named
 * a Householder matrix (not because Householder invented the concept, which
 * had been known for about a century, but because he found new and interesting
 * ways to use them). We will always assume that v(0) = 1 and therefore we will
 * only require the knowledge of v(1:n), the so-called essential part of the
 * reflector [2].
 *
 *
 * The latter variant nicely factor out the pattern used throughout LAPACK
 * that consists in setting to 1 the matrix element corresponding to v(0),
 * then applying the reflector, and finally restoring the original value of
 * that matrix element.

 *
 * [2] LAPACK only ever constructs reflectors with v(0) = 1 but the subroutine
 * applying the reflectors to matrices do not assume that, forcing the client
 * code using them to set v(0) = 1 by hand, and eventually to restore v(0) to
 * its original value because v always share storage with a matrix row or column
 * for which v(0) aliases an element that is part of the desired output. We
 * prefer to avoid this ugly hack altogether.
