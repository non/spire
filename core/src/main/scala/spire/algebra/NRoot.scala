/**
 * This is a type class for types with n-roots. The value returned by `nroot`
 * and `sqrt` are only guaranteed to be approximate answers (except in the case
 * of `Real`).
 *
 * Also, generally `nroot`s where `n` is even are not defined for
 * negative numbers. The behaviour is undefined if this is attempted. It would
 * be nice to ensure an exception is raised, but some types may defer
 * computation and testing if a value is negative may not be ideal. So, do not
 * count on `ArithmeticException`s to save you from bad arithmetic!
