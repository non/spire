/**
 * Describes an involution, which is an operator that satisfies f(f(x)) = x (rule i).
 *
 * If a multiplicative semigroup is available, it describes an antiautomorphism (rule ii);
 * on a multiplicative monoid, it preserves the identity (rule iii).
 *
 * If a ring is available, it should be compatible with addition (rule iv), and then defines
 * a *-ring (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2A-algebra ).
 *
 *   i. adjoint(adjoint(x)) = x
 *  ii.        adjoint(x*y) = adjoint(y)*adjoint(x) (with an underlying multiplicative semigroup)
 * iii.          adjoint(1) = 1 (with an underlying multiplicative monoid)
 *  iv.        adjoint(x+y) = adjoint(x)+adjoint(y) (with an underlying ring)
 *
 * A *-algebra is an associative algebra A over a commutative *-ring R, where A has an involution
 * as well. It satisfies, for x: A, y: A and r: R
 *
 *   v.  adjoint(r * x + y) = adjoint(r)*adjoint(x) + adjoint(y)
