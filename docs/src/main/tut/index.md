Spire is a numeric library for Scala which is intended to be generic, fast,
and precise.

Using features such as specialization, macros, type classes, and implicits,
Spire works hard to defy conventional wisdom around performance and precision
trade-offs. A major goal is to allow developers to write efficient numeric
code without having to "bake in" particular numeric representations. In most
cases, generic implementations using Spire's specialized type classes perform
identically to corresponding direct implementations.

This site intends to help users navigate Spire's type classes, numbers types,
and other capabilities offered by the library.
